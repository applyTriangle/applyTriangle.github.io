Their program, titled "New York Counterpoint," was subsequently showcased at music conservatories in Dresden, Weimar, and Leipzig. During these visits, they engaged in rich discussions with students about integrating technology in contemporary music through several workshop performances. This same program was also featured at the Manhattan School of Music and the PENN SOUND Collective at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2020, they collaborated with violinist and composer Yaz Lancaster on the premiere of intangible landscapes at NYU’s Pulsing and Shaking Macro Festival.
