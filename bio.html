              <p>Apply Triangle is a NYC-based electroacoustic trio comprised of Yoshi Weinberg (flutes), Christopher Foss (bassoon/shakuhachi), and Jixue Yang (piano/keyboards). Their music utilizes live electronics like video projection, lighting elements, and audio playback, as well as amplification and processing of each acoustic instruments in real-time, to bring a multimedia experience to audiences and push the boundaries of live chamber music.</p>
              <p>Apply Triangle is dedicated to collaborating with and performing music by emerging composers whose work addresses the modern political, social, and environmental issues we face as a society today such as deforestation, mental health and anxiety, and the fight for women's equality and LGBTQIA rights. They maintain an open-door policy for their collaborations, inviting composers and other artists into their rehearsals to workshop and discuss the musical and technological capabilities for new electroacoustic chamber works.</p>
              <p>In 2019, Apply Triangle made their international debut at the SinusTon Electronic Music Festival in Magdeburg, Germany. Here, they premiered three new pieces by New York composers James Diaz, Alex Held, and Pranav Datla, complemented by an array of standard electroacoustic solos for each instrument. Their program, titled "New York Counterpoint," was subsequently showcased at music conservatories in Dresden, Weimar, and Leipzig. During these visits, they engaged in rich discussions with students about integrating technology in contemporary music through several workshop performances. This same program was also featured at the Manhattan School of Music and the <a href="https://music.sas.upenn.edu/graduate/composition/penn-sound-collective" style="color:hotpink;">PENN SOUND Collective</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2020, they collaborated with violinist and composer Yaz Lancaster on the premiere of intangible landscapes at NYU’s Pulsing and Shaking Macro Festival. From 2021 to 2022, as guest artists at both Bowling Green State University and the University of Florida’s College of the Arts, Apply Triangle conducted workshop performances and hosted Q&A sessions on technological applications in contemporary music. In 2021, Apply Triangle was honored with the Chamber Music America <a href="https://chambermusicamerica.org/grantees/apply-triangle/" style="color: hotpink;">Ensemble Forward Award</a>.</p>
              <p>Since 2020, Apply Triangle has focused on their first Call for Scores as they collaborate with over thirty composers from around the world on concise electroacoustic works to be recorded remotely and released on <a href="https://cmntxrecords.com" style="color:hotpink">cmntx records</a> on April 12th, 2024.</p>
