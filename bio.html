              <p>Apply Triangle is a NYC-based electroacoustic trio that utilizes technology to curate engaging performances that evolve and expand the repertoire for flutes, clarinets, and piano. Our music utilizes live electronics like video projection, lighting elements and audio playback, as well as amplifying and processing each of our acoustic instruments in real time to bring a multimedia experience to our audiences and push the boundaries of live chamber music.</p>
              <p>Apply Triangle is dedicated to collaborating with and performing music by emerging composers whose work addresses the modern political, social, and environmental issues we face as a society today. Some of our current collaborations explore the topics of deforestation, mental health and anxiety, and the fight for women's equality and LGBTQIA rights. We maintain an open-door policy for our collaborations, inviting composers and other artists into our rehearsals to workshop and discuss the musical and technological capabilities for new electroacoustic chamber works.</p>
              <p>This past year, Apply Triangle made our international debut at the SinusTon Electronic Music Festival in Magdeburg, Germany in October, premiering three new works by New York  composers James Diaz, Alex Held, and Pranav Datla, along with a variety of standard electroacoustic solos for each of our instruments. We brought our program, titled New York Counterpoint, to music conservatories in Dresden, Weimar, and Leipzig where we also engaged with many of the students in discussions on the use of technology within contemporary music during several workshop performances. We also collaborated with violinist and composer Yaz Lancaster on their new work intangible landscapes premiered at the 2020 NYU Pulsing and Shaking Macro Festival.</p>
              <p>
              Apply Triangle’s 2020 season will focus on our first Call for Scores to collaborate with composers around the world on short electroacoustic works which we will record in our homes and release as a series of albums throughout the year. Future projects include performances at the Greenlight New Music Festival in Duluth, MN and at Spectrum in NYC, featuring premieres of new works by J. Paul Bourque, Lydia Chang, Dan Antoniu, Marisa Tornello, Lily Shababi and others.</p>
