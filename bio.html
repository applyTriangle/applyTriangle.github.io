              <p>Apply Triangle is a NYC-based electroacoustic trio comprised of Yoshi Weinberg (flutes), Tyler Neidermayer (clarinets), and Jixue Yang (piano/keyboards). Their music utilizes live electronics like video projection, lighting elements, and audio playback, as well as amplification and processing of each acoustic instruments in real-time, to bring a multimedia experience to audiences and push the boundaries of live chamber music.</p>
              <p>Apply Triangle is dedicated to collaborating with and performing music by emerging composers whose work addresses the modern political, social, and environmental issues we face as a society today such as deforestation, mental health and anxiety, and the fight for women's equality and LGBTQIA rights.

              <p>In 2019, Apply Triangle made their international debut at the SinusTon Electronic Music Festival in Magdeburg, Germany. Here, they premiered three new pieces by New York composers James Diaz, Alex Held, and Pranav Datla, complemented by an array of standard electroacoustic solos for each instrument. Their program, titled "New York Counterpoint," was subsequently showcased at music conservatories in Dresden, Weimar, and Leipzig. During these visits, they engaged in rich discussions with students about integrating technology in contemporary music through several workshop performances. This same program was also featured at the Manhattan School of Music and the PENN SOUND Collective at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2020, they collaborated with violinist and composer Yaz Lancaster on the premiere of intangible landscapes at NYU’s Pulsing and Shaking Macro Festival.
