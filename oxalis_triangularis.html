            Oxalis Triangularis stems from the resilience of artists to continue
            to create through a global pandemic. It is a testament to the
            flexibility and creativity possible through electroacoustic
            composition. Developed through a call for scores in the summer of
            2020, Oxalis Triangularis (referring to a purple “false shamrock”
            whose scientific name is Oxalis Triangularis due to its
            triangle-like leaves) features 33 new works written specifically to
            be recorded in a fully remote setting. Over the course of three
            albums Apply Triangle not only showcases the innovative techniques
            of 33 living composers but also highlights the embodied cultural
            nuances inherent in each composer's style.

                    The 11 works on this volume give an introduction to Apply
                    Triangle’s unique and creative style of performing with
                    electronics, as well as a wide range of compositional
                    voices. The compositions on this volume were all primarily
                    recorded in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    Each member of Apply Triangle recorded their parts
                    individually without reference to the others’. These
                    individual stems were then later mixed together with the
                    electronic elements to create the finished piece.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The idea of “alone together” permeates throughout this
                    album, as well as resilience within the artist community to
                    continue to create during a global pandemic. The
                    compositions range from sorrowful, earnest, nostalgic,
                    angry, and meditative. Several compositions utilize spoken
                    word, field recordings, and samples to compliment the colors
                    of Apply Triangle’s instrumentation of flute, clarinet, and
                    piano. Electronic processing of the acoustic instruments
                    expand and distort AT’s sound, allowing for endless
                    possibilities of sonic realizations.
                  </p>
                  Recording these works allowed me to feel connected again
                  during a time of extreme loneliness. It gave me hope for a
                  future and although at times the task seemed insurmountable,
                  these compositions gave me the focus and energy to challenge
                  myself like never before. These tracks are the fruits of our
                  labor, given lovingly to you, and while we carry the scars of
                  our past we continue forward to bloom in a brighter garden.

                    The music on "Oxalis Triangularis: Vol. 2" showcases an
                    incredible depth of influence and variety within the
                    confines of our instrumentation coupled with the endless
                    possibilities of electronic processing. Relentless
                    industrialism, booming 808 beats, circuit-bent mayhem and
                    Bosche-esque maximalism highlight the extreme worlds these
                    composers created for us to explore and discover, all woven
                    together with interluding improvisations that challenged us
                    to reflect on the standstill times these works were created
                    in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Looking back on the process of bringing these works to life,
                    I am so grateful for the time taken and the time received to
                    grow with this music. Some of these recordings were made to
                    be read and recorded in one day, whereas others took months
                    to track all of the parts, make precise edits and allow time
                    for our brains to breathe a bit before we could start on the
                    next one. There were many times in our nearly four year long
                    journey where it all felt stagnant and we didn’t know what
                    to do next or what deadlines were approaching. Other times,
                    we were locked into our flow and felt so excited for what
                    the next piece held. When the time finally came to structure
                    these albums and tell this story, these moments of highs and
                    lows, rapid movement and complete stillness, still felt
                    present as the pieces connected and began to relate to one
                    another in ways we never imagined.
                  </p>
                  Thank you to all of the composers who dedicated their time and
                  talents to this music and advising us every step of the way.
                  Thank you to my two friends, Yoshi and Jixue, for seeing this
                  idea through and committing to our music.

                    While recording and mixing our parts individually, the
                    robust flavors of the music never diminished despite the
                    physical distance. Upon revisiting the final mixes from our
                    three-year journey, I came to the realization that each
                    musical fragment had unconsciously and deeply engraved
                    itself into my mind. These pieces, when brought together,
                    have transformed into a macrocosmic kaleidoscope. They stand
                    as separate pieces, yet also weave a tapestry of memories,
                    forming a synthesis of the entire amalgam of mixed-taste
                    dream that whispers nuanced emotions and mirrors the time of
                    quarantine. </p><p> Unlike the stable recording environments that
                    Tyler and Yoshi had, I can't recall how many different
                    instruments, or simply pianos, I've recorded on, and how
                    many different spaces I've borrowed to record in. Sometimes
                    on a Steinway model D in a nice concert hall, while other
                    times it could be a detuned old piano in a room where trains
                    constantly passed by. There was always a chance. Despite the
                    inconsistency in timbre and tuning across each of them, this
                    “imperfection” ultimately breathes life into each piece,
                    making them non-replicable.</p><p> We communicate through
                    interactions, consciously, with our instruments. The
                    electronics, with their unfettered character, offer an array
                    of imaginative possibilities, or the two extremes: to
                    connect or to disconnect. The electronic elements of each
                    piece are so different that sometimes they compress the
                    space, pushing me out of the room, and other times they
                    dissect the integrated space into fragmented jigsaw puzzles
                    while still tethered to each other. After all, isn’t all
                    continuity just an ignorance of smaller diagrams? Aren't we
                    all just together and alone? </p><p> The music in this last volume
                    moves through hope, desperation, peace, isolation,
                    acceptance, struggle, and the wistful strains of longing. As
                    they traverse the realms once more, do we only hear each
                    other's music, or do we see ourselves as a part of it? </p>…
                    Time seems to stand still when the music plays and resumes
                    its course when the music pauses. I find myself trapped in
                    time, dwelling immersed in the most special moments.
